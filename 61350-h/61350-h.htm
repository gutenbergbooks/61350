<p><span class="smcap">The Editor</span> feels bound to record, for
the pleasure of the general reader of
this magazine, some of the charming
expressions of goodwill called forth by
the publication of the 1000th Number.
He has been greatly cheered by them,
and he knows so well that the readers
will share the pleasure with him that he
will unclose to them some of his recent
correspondence, the actual letters themselves
being sent to the printer as MS.</p>

<p>First, from readers old and young, and
from every nation under the sun, he has
received hearty congratulations.</p>

<p>One kind girl near London writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I must congratulate you on the charming
1000th Number of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>.
It is a very nice idea, giving the photographs
of the contributors to the paper. I have taken
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> since it first came
out, never missing one week, and I have also
every one of the Summer and Christmas
numbers. Although I was away one year on
a sea-voyage, the paper was taken for me.
When it first came out, I was quite a child;
my mother took it for me, and I have always
enjoyed reading it. I consider it the best
paper published for either old or young, and
would not give it up for anything. When I
saw the 1000th number, I felt I must write and
tell you what an old subscriber you had and
one who appreciates <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>
so much. It is not many, I think, could say
they have every week of the paper. Wishing
it every success for the future,</p>

<p class="right">
Believe me to be faithfully yours, N. H.
</p></div>

<p>Another reader writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>,—I have just been reading
the 1000th Number of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span>, and I feel I must write to thank you
(and congratulate you) for the pleasures and
benefits which I have received from it during a
very long acquaintance; in fact I knew it in its
very first days, and distinctly remember being
keenly interested in the tale “Zara, or, My
Granddaughter’s Money.” I was really a girl
then, and it seems, and is, a long, long while ago.
I can but echo heartily Miss Burnside’s wish
that it may live another 1000 weeks, and yet
another; and—who knows?—another on to
that. I should think one great reason for
its popularity is that it suits so many different
sorts of minds. There is no doubt that when
catering for our mental food, you have remembered
the old saying that “variety is charming.”
More, it is also wholesome. With
every good wish for a yet wider circulation of
our dear paper, and the welfare of our Editor,</p>

<p class="right">
Believe me, truly yours, A. M.
</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Also one from the country:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Editor</span>,—I must write to thank you
for presenting to us (to me) “Portrait Gallery
of Contributors” to our dear <span class="smcap">Girl’s Own
Paper</span>. It is so nice to see their faces, to
really know what those that give us pleasure,
profit, etc., are like. Very nice to see our
dear Editor’s face. We now know the one who
for so many years has laboured much for us—your
“girls.” No words will come to me to
express all the gratitude I feel to you and all
your helpers. God bless you, and all the
others, and richly reward you, even here. You
cannot see the great pleasure with which <span class="smcap">The
Girl’s Own Paper</span> is read as each month
comes; and re-reading it and all those that
have gone before is just as great; but let this
letter just let you know how one heart is often
cheered and encouraged to go on through its
perusal. I did not mean when I began this
letter to write about myself, only to try and
express my loving thanks. Forgive all I
have written, and let me sign myself</p>

<p class="right">
One of your grateful girls, <span class="smcap">Ellie</span>.
</p></div>

<p>Scores of girls in their teens, some of
them only recent subscribers, write enthusiastically
and in good taste; but
as there is perforce much similarity in
them, it is not desirable to print them.</p>

<p>However, the two following are
original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear and Honoured Sir</span>,—I can hardly
call myself one of the girl readers of <span class="smcap">The
Girl’s Own Paper</span>, seeing that I am on
the shady side of seventy years old, and a wife of
many years standing; but still I consider that
I may take to myself the pleasant things you
say in your article in the 1000th Number. You
will think so too when I tell you that I have
read almost every word in the nineteen
volumes, and possess the said volumes all bound.
I quite agree with the critics in what they
say of the value of the publication, and also
with them hope that you and your staff may
long continue to instruct, amuse, and advise
the “many millions” of the girls of the world.
You see that if I were to subscribe myself “A
Constant Reader,” I should not be telling an
untruth; but I will only say</p>

<p class="right">
Yours gratefully, R. C. R.
</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Editor</span>,—Having been a constant
reader of your <span class="smcap">Girl’s Own Paper</span> for
many years, I have long been very desirous of
thanking you and those who contribute to it
for many pleasant and enjoyable hours I have
spent in reading its pages; it contains something
to suit all.</p>

<p>I sometimes think I ought to discontinue
magazines and books of the sort, but when I
look on my dear old friend, <span class="smcap">The Girl’s
Own Paper</span>, I am constrained to say, How
can I give thee up? So it comes on as usual,
and is looked forward to and read as eagerly
as ever.</p>

<p>May it go on and prosper in future as it has
in the past.</p>

<p>Thank you also much for the nice Portrait
Gallery; it gives me much pleasure to look at
it and make comments on faces mentally,
some brimming over with loving kindness, and
others so thoughtful, and all good.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Editor, please forgive me for
intruding on your very valuable time.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="mr6">Believe me,</span><br />
<span class="mr2">Very faithfully and gratefully yours,</span><br />
One who at eighty-three has never tired of
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own</span>.</p></div>

<p>Another old reader who has every number
mentions this with great pride, and
adds, “I wonder how many could say
the same.” This is also the wonder of
the Editor, but he fears that it would be
impossible to find out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From our many and valued contributors,
we have received hearty congratulations,
but as their letters have a distinctly
personal tendency, we can only
quote from them.</p>

<p>A quite <i>new</i> writer on our staff says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Until I received my monthly number of
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> this morning I did
not realise what an important one it was.
Allow me to add my congratulations to the
many you have already doubtless received on
the success attending your venture. I find
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> a household word
wherever I go, and quite as much appreciated
in Ireland and Scotland as in England. I
think you have solved the problem how to
instruct as well as amuse our daughters and
young people most wonderfully, and feel proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">{483}</a></span>
to be on your staff. I have been delayed in
sending you the rest of my papers by fresh
bereavement and continued illness. In a short
time, however, I hope they will be in your
hands. With repeated well wishes of a longer
life and even more success to the magazine.</p></div>

<p>A quite <i>old</i> writer on our staff says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My congratulations on the issue of No.
1000 of our dear <span class="smcap">Girl’s Own Paper</span> in her
pretty new dress. You must look back on
the nearly twenty years of healthy, useful,
and refining life that your and our paper has
passed through with infinite pleasure and
thankfulness, for it has been and it is a blessing
both to the girls and their elders. It
was with no little emotion that I looked at
No. 1000, for to my connection with <span class="smcap">The
Girl’s Own Paper</span> I am indebted for one
who has been from the beginning of our
acquaintance the best and truest of friends
to me that I am proud to call such. May
God bless you, and give you in the future to
see more and more abundant fruit for your
labours. It seemed so wonderful for me to be
able to say, “I had one complete short paper
and two chapters of another in the second
number of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>, and the
1000th Number has in it a paper of mine also.”
Didn’t I feel proud when I saw a paper of
mine in <i>the</i> number? I have grown, I will
not say gray, but very white in the service of
<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>, and it will cost me
a terrible pang when I am no longer able to
write anything worthy of a place in the dear,
familiar pages. I am trying to get new
subscribers to our paper. I got two at the
beginning of the volume. If only each reader
could get one more! The paper ought to be
a greater favourite than ever, for it is prettier,
and has never been in every way so good as it
is now.</p></div>

<p>One who has written but very seldom
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Old Friend</span>,—Amid the
many cries of congratulation from important
people and numerous friends, let my small
voice be heard. It seems to me a great
triumph, in spite of opposition, to have sailed
calmly on and made your thousandth port
unattended by serious rivals.</p>

<p>My own idea of celebrating such an event is
a dinner given by “the staff” to the Editor,
and I for one would make a struggle to form
one of such an interesting and pleasing
company.</p>

<p>What happy memories for me are included
in that span of 1000 Numbers, <i>quorum pars
parva fui</i>.</p></div>

<p>Another very occasional contributor
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This wonderful number of the <span class="smcap">Girl’s Own
Paper</span> will quite overwhelm you with congratulations,
I am sure, for it is a record one!
For myself, I am humbly delighted with it,
and I never hope to have a greater honour than
to be associated with so many infinitely more
worthy names than my own.</p>

<p>This number will be treasured in the annals
of the family, especially, too, as I see dear
friends’ faces as well therein, and I am next
but one to my father’s life-long friend.</p>

<p>You must have taken such an amount of
pains to collect all the photographs, and our
thanks are immensely due to you for all your
kind trouble and taste in doing so. While
most heartily echoing the first four lines of
the last stanza of our valued mutual friend,
Miss Helen Burnside,</p>

<p class="right">
Believe me, yours sincerely, ——.<br />
</p></div>

<p>An old favourite story writer—we wonder
if our readers can guess the writer
by the style!—sends the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many thanks for the lovely number! I
wish I could live in the Vicar of Wakefield’s
room on the first page. How nice if we could
all dine there on a summer evening!</p>

<p>Is it 1000 weeks ago since you started the
<span class="smcap">Girl’s Own Paper</span>? Old days come back—I
go into Cassell’s and see you for the first
time. And then I think of the old kindness
and faithful friendship, and feel inclined to
cry a little! You have done a wonderful
work for girls; you have directed their feet to
that narrow path in which alone they can find
peace. It is a path that runs beside the
Living Waters. Because it is so narrow the
women of to-day are demanding a wider
range, and so go a-wandering. Yesterday I
received a copy of the —— from the editor,
who asks for a portrait and sketch. In it
there is rather a strong paper on the Religion
of Women, or, rather, their irreligion. In my
sketch, I ventured to touch on the true freedom
that can only be obtained through
restraint, and on the discipline of the interior
life.</p>

<p>I think we can see very clearly that Almighty
God has blessed you in your work, and I feel
sure that you will be helped and strengthened
to the end. This is my prayer for you.</p></div>

<p>One of our musical contributors sends
a spirited setting (we have great pleasure
in printing it in this Number) of
Miss Burnside’s “Success and Long
Life to the ‘G. O. P.,’” published in the
1000th Number, with the following kind
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Best of Friends</span>,—I enclose a little
memento of the 1000th Number, over which
and its editor we pray for the best of luck.</p>

<p>The enclosed “phrases” may seem rather
trite, but equally trite is fast friendship, ripened
affection and a grateful heart, of all of which
accept this token from</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Your Old Contributor</span>.
</p></div>

<p>A brother Editor, who has for many
years afforded us friendly counsel and
encouragement, but who is now, alas!
no longer near at hand, sends the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I congratulate you on your thousand weeks,
and on the promise which the energy and
attractiveness of your thousandth issue give
you of a thousand more. It is no small
achievement to have held together so sympathetic
a team of writers, and to have carried
forward such a work so long with general
approval.</p>

<p>I miss my chats with you and ——. By
way of consolation, the last fortnight I have
been clearing out arrears of MSS. and old
letters. How they gather in the dust! They
make me realise how much is past, and also
how much wider and more various is an editor’s
work than the part he gives to the public.
This you know well, but for you is the future!
May it be riper, richer, happier in all its years.</p></div>

<p>From the Editor of an important and
long-established magazine, under whom
we were trained, comes the following
genial letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A thousand thanks for your 1000th Number,
which is as bright and genial and clever as its
Editor, and that’s saying a great deal for it.
Your greeting does my heart good, but it
brings me no sting of reproach. I often
think of you, my dear old friend, and of the
pleasant times we had together in the dear
old days. Such is the force of habit that I
still think of you as a youngster, and I thank
your portrait for confirming that impression.
Good luck to you, and to your thousand-week-old
baby, and when she scores her second
thousand, “may I be there to see” and to
rejoice with you.</p>

Your affectionate old chum, ——.<br />

<p>Last, but not least, we must mention,
with sincere gratitude, a letter of congratulation
from our painstaking printers.
Also great indebtedness is due to the
Officers of the Society for their expressions

<p class="center">WHAT THE PRESS SAYS:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>—the most successful
paper ever published for girls, alike
from the pecuniary point of view, and from
the point of view of supplying girls with literature
equally wholesome and welcome—has
just reached its thousandth number. Long
may it live.”—<i>The Queen.</i></p>

<p>“With the thousandth number of <span class="smcap">The
Girl’s Own Paper</span>, dated February 25th, is
given a detached “Portrait Gallery,” containing
the likeness of 105 contributors to that
excellent periodical, among whom are the
Queen of Roumania, Princess Beatrice, and
(as it is fairly claimed) ‘many queens and
princesses of prose, poesy, and music’—not to
speak of princes.”—<i>The Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“Without any trace of mawkish piety, it
has always set before its readers the ideal of
first things first, and has never descended to
the depths of sensationalism to secure a wider
circulation.”—<i>Methodist Times.</i></p>

<p>“I congratulate <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>,
which celebrates its thousandth birthday. It
still leads.”—<i>Sketch.</i></p>

<p>“The idea of its publication was a very
happy one, and it has been thoroughly well
carried out with sense, with catholicity, and with
quickness of perception.”—<i>British Weekly.</i></p>

<p>“The Editor says—‘Success shone upon us
from the very first.’ That that success may
never wane will be the hope of many thousands
of present readers and of past readers who are
no longer girls—women who realise that their
lives were not only made brighter and happier
by the Magazine, but better, fuller, and more
useful.”—<i>Brighton Herald.</i></p>

<p>“Let us congratulate the Editor and the
Publishers of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>
upon the success which is indicated by the
G. O. P. (as its readers affectionately call it)
attaining its thousandth number. As the interests
of girls have widened—and between
the years 1880 and 1899 they have widened
greatly—the scope of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span> has correspondingly enlarged, and
there would appear to be no subject which
young women can present to the consideration
of the Editor of this favourite organ upon which
they will not receive the most sympathetic and
judicious advice.”—<i>The Queen.</i></p>

<h2><a name="SHEILA" id="SHEILA">SHEILA.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">A STORY FOR GIRLS.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> EVELYN EVERETT-GREEN, Author of “Greyfriars,” “Half-a-dozen Sisters,” etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p class="ph3">EFFIE.</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox w200">
<img class="idropcap" src="images/i_486.jpg" width="200" height="303" alt='T' /></div>

<p><span class="uppercase">he</span> two girls
remained
quite still for
a few minutes,
looking curiously at
one another. Mrs.
Cossart, who had brought Sheila up to
her daughter’s bright, pretty sitting-room,
had been obliged to leave them
after speaking a few phrases of introduction,
as there were visitors awaiting
her in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Sheila saw, half reclined upon a
couch beside the fire, a girl with a
pinched face, dark hair and brown eyes,
which looked out rather sharply through
a pair of “nippers.” The girl was thin,
but she did not look exactly ill. There
was something a little defiant in her
air as she raised herself and spoke to
her visitor.</p>

<p>“So you are Sheila? Come here
and sit down, and let us talk. I have
heard a lot about you, and I suppose
you’ve heard plenty about me. I wonder
what kind of things the Tom Cossarts say
about me in private. I always think
they call me a humbug.”</p>

<p>“No, they don’t,” answered Sheila
quickly, as she came forward, “I think
they are kind people. They were all
very kind to me.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you would have liked to
stay there altogether. You don’t think
it will be so amusing, shut up here with
me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell till I try,” answered
Sheila smiling, rather puzzled by Effie’s
sharp speeches. “I liked being in River
Street pretty well. But—well—it didn’t
seem much like home. This house is
much nicer. I think if you like having
me, I shall like being here. I hope you
will like me, Effie.”</p>

<p>Sheila spoke simply and impulsively,
and Effie smiled, and her face looked
pleasanter than it had done as yet.</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay we shall get on. I’m
not so cross as I expect you’ve been
told. Once I was just cram full of fun,
but being ill takes the life out of you.
Sometimes I hate everything and
everybody, but then I get better, and
things seem different. Have you ever
been ill? Do you know what it’s like?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered Sheila, “I’m
very strong. Oscar has been ill oftener
than I. Tell me about yourself, Effie?
I want to know everything. Your
mother wants me to be a sort of sister
to you. Sisters ought to know everything
about each other.”</p>

<p>Effie, nothing loath, began a long
history of herself. In a few days’ time
Sheila had discovered that the way to
keep her most satisfied and entertained
was to let her talk about herself. Poor
child, it was scarcely her own fault.
Her mother never tired of asking her
about her every symptom, and listening
to her accounts of how every hour had
been passed. She talked almost ceaselessly
of Effie to everybody who would
listen. She had almost lost her identity
in that of her last surviving child. It
seemed to Sheila that poor Effie had had
enough doctors and enough experiments
in treatment tried upon her to kill anybody,
and when she ventured to say as
much to Effie herself, the girl at once
and cordially agreed.</p>

<p>“I hate the very sight of them. I
feel as though I’d never have another
near me. I mean not to care now
whether I get better or not. The harder
I try, the worse I am. I’m just not
going to care about anything again!”</p>

<p>That was decidedly one of Effie’s
moods—a sort of defiance of everything
and everybody. At other times she
would be gentler, sometimes she was
depressed. Then she would have a
spell of high spirits, in which she often
overdid herself, and brought on one
of her attacks of breathlessness and
oppression.</p>

<p>Sheila looked on and listened and
wondered. Sometimes she was quite
fond of Effie, sorry for her, and eager
to do anything she could. At others,
again, she felt a decided longing to
shake her, and grew fairly out of
patience at the way she had of bringing
every subject started round to herself
again. Others had noticed this defect
in Effie. Her cousins had named it in
Sheila’s hearing, but they had never
spoken of it to the girl herself, and
Sheila never meant to; but one day
almost in spite of herself, the words
sprang to her lips.</p>

<p>“Effie, do you ever think about anything
or anybody but yourself? I do
think you’d be so much better if you
would. I don’t know if you know it
or care; but you talk about yourself
from morning to night. It does get
so tiresome, and I’m sure it’s bad for
you!”</p>

<p>Effie stopped short in what she was
about to say, and stared at Sheila hard.
The girl coloured under the sharp gaze.
Sheila was very placable by nature, and
hated anybody to be angry with her;
but she had not learned the lesson yet
of thinking before she spoke.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon if I vexed you,”
she said; “but——”</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” said Effie shortly; “I
don’t want to hear any more! You can
go now! You’d better take that ride
you’ve been wanting to so long! I
don’t want anybody with me who thinks
it tiresome to talk to me!”</p>

<p>Sheila escaped from the room, half
inclined to laugh, and half to cry.
Shamrock had arrived at Cossart Place
two days ago, and she was eager to
have a gallop upon her; but Effie had
not been well, and she had not liked to
leave her. She fled away now to her
own room, and put on her habit. Her
cheeks were glowing with the excitement
of her little quarrel with Effie, and with
the prospect of her ride upon her favourite.
She thought most likely she would get
a scolding from her aunt on Effie’s
account; but, after all, was it not a
good thing for somebody to warn Effie
of her besetting weakness? Sheila was
sure she did not want to be selfish. She
had many kind thoughts and plans for
other people. Only she had got so into
the way of being the first consideration
with everybody about her. It was enough
to spoil anybody.</p>

<p>When she was dressed, Sheila slipped
down the almost unused staircase of the
old part of the house; and made her
way direct to the stable-yard. Sheila
had obtained her wished-for quarters,
and had two pleasant rooms of her own
in the block of old building, which she
liked so much better than the great
modern addition, where the reception-rooms
were, and where the family had
their quarters. Her belongings, and a
good many of Oscar’s, were stored here,
and made her rooms home-like and
bright. When Oscar came to see her,
they felt almost in a separate house of
their own. On the whole, Sheila was
very pleased with her new life. She
was kindly treated, and things were all
smooth and easy. So long as she
pleased Effie, that was all anybody
expected of her; and so far Effie had
seemed to like her companionship. But
Sheila began to wonder how things
would be if she got into Effie’s black
books. She fancied that her Aunt
Cossart could be pretty severe to anybody
who offended or distressed her
darling.</p>

<p>However, what was done could not
be undone, and Sheila’s nature was
hopeful and elastic. She ran to the
coachman, and begged him to have
Shamrock saddled for her, and laughed
and shook her head when he suggested
that a groom should attend her.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I always rode alone at home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">{487}</a></span>
if my father or Oscar could not come
with me,” she answered; “Shamrock
is perfectly safe. I want to explore the
country. Some of the roads look quite
pretty.”</p>

<p>She was soon mounted on her favourite,
who expressed pleasure at having her
pretty mistress on her back once more.
Sheila was equally delighted, and rode
gaily along the lanes, the sunshine
throwing dancing lights and shadows
across her path. She followed one
winding lane after another, feeling joyfully
the freedom of her independence,
after being so many days shut up in the
house, with only an occasional run into
the garden; and she could hardly regret
the little tiff with Effie which had brought
it about.</p>

<p>“I’ll ride down to the works and see
Oscar!” cried Sheila, as she paused
upon the brow of a little hill, and saw
the town and the chimneys lying like a
map before her. “I should like to see
him at his treadmill, poor boy; but he
seems to like the work pretty well. He
is a good boy, and never complains. I
should, I know, if I were in his shoes.”</p>

<p>Sheila’s plan was put into speedy
execution, and before long she had
ridden into the enclosure surrounded by
her uncle’s buildings, and had asked for
her brother.</p>

<p>Oscar came out to her with a smile on
his face but surprise in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you all alone, Sheila? How did
you get leave to come?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask. Why should I? I just
came. Effie was cross, and sent me
away, and I got Shamrock saddled, and
here I am!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I think you should have
asked Aunt Cossart first! They say
she is very nervous about girls riding,
and would never let them go alone.
Besides, through the town it isn’t perhaps
quite usual. It’s not like being at home,
Sheila.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I hadn’t thought of going
to the town when I started, Oscar, so
you needn’t look so solemn! Nobody
knows I’m out; so Aunt Cossart can’t
be getting anxious. I want to see what
you are doing, so that I may picture
you better.”</p>

<p>North came up at this moment, and
had a kindly welcome for his young
cousin. He rather laughed at her
independence, but was ready enough
to have her horse taken care of whilst
she went to see Oscar’s “treadmill,”
and saw various interesting things at
the works. Her pretty appealing little
ways amused him, and he was quite
ready to make something of a pet of
her, as were most other people. She
forgot all her troubles, laughed, chatted,
and talked to the work-people, the
clerks, and everybody she met, until
finally a great bell booming out overhead
proclaimed the hour of one; and Sheila
realised that she should be late for
luncheon.</p>

<p>Oscar put her up, and she started
forth at a rapid pace, and covered the
two miles between the works and Cossart
Place in very good time; nevertheless
she saw a visible commotion at the door
as she cantered up the drive, and was
aware that both her aunt and uncle were
on the look-out, as well as several
servants.</p>

<p>“Did they expect me to return on a
shutter?” questioned the girl of herself,
with a feeling of mischievous glee. She
was in good spirits from her little
jaunt, and was amazed by the agitated
whiteness of her aunt’s face, as she
dismounted and ran up the steps into
the hall.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to be late; but I overlooked
the time. I was at the works,
seeing Oscar and the people there. I
hope you haven’t waited! Effie sent
me off to have a ride, and it’s so
delightful having Shamrock again! I
did so enjoy it!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart said not a word but
turned again to the dining-room. The
servants were about, and she had no
intention of saying what was in her
mind before them.</p>

<p>Mr. Cossart shook his head and said
reprovingly—</p>

<p>“You have made us very seriously
uneasy, Sheila. You ought not to have
gone off like that without leave—and
alone, too. We want you to be happy;
but you must not be a modern unladylike
girl, galloping alone over the country,
and into the town too. I hope nobody
saw you who would know you. What
would they have thought of such proceedings?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—probably nothing. I
used to ride about everywhere at home,”
answered Sheila, feeling rather aggrieved
at the way her very small escapade was
being treated. She took her seat at
table; Effie’s was vacant.</p>

<p>Mr. Cossart asked if she were not
coming down. “Was she not so well
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Effie has been upset!” said Mrs.
Cossart coldly. “She is not well enough
to come down!” And she gave a look
at Sheila which sent the blood into her
cheeks. She knew very well that she
was in disgrace; but her spirit rose
against what seemed to her to be
injustice; and she talked on gaily all
through the meal, not apparently heeding
the silence of her elders.</p>

<p>When she rose from table her aunt
summoned her to the little boudoir
sacred to her own use; and once
within the door, the storm broke over
her head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cossart did not profess to know
what had passed between the girls; but
she knew that Sheila had said unkind
things to Effie, and had reduced her to
tears and made her very unhappy and
agitated. That sort of thing could not
and must not be. Effie was in no state
to be upset. Probably she would have
a return of the asthma and a succession
of bad nights. Sheila must remember
that ill-health was a terrible trial, and
she must be kindly and gentle and
unselfish. In vain Sheila strove to
explain how very little it was she had
said, and that she had apologised
afterwards. Mrs. Cossart was rather
like her daughter in one way; she liked
to keep the ball of conversation in her
own hands. She wanted to talk, not to
listen. In the end Sheila grew angry.
She was not used to being found fault
with. She felt she was being unjustly
treated, about Effie, about her ride, about
her lateness for lunch. She had done
nothing wrong. No harm had happened.
It was horrid of her aunt to make such
a to-do. The penitence she had felt at
the outset was quickly gone, and when
she finally flew up to her own room, it
was to shed a tempest of angry tears
and resolve that she would never, never
care one bit for Effie, and that her aunt
was a hard, unjust woman, whom she
could never care to please.</p>

<p>“I shall never be happy here, and I’ll
tell Uncle Tom so. I’ll tell Cyril how
they treat me. I’ll get away and live
somewhere with Oscar. I’ve never been
scolded so before, and I won’t stand it.
If I’d done wrong, I should be sorry,
but to tell Effie she talked about herself
too much, and to take a ride on Shamrock!—no,
I won’t be sorry about that!
I won’t, I won’t!”</p>

<p>She changed her dress, and began to
wonder what she should do next. It
was dull all alone up here, though the
room was bright and pretty enough.
She stood looking out of the window,
and presently she saw Cyril’s figure
approaching the house by the short cut
through the garden. He had promised
to come and see her soon, and surely
this was his expected visit. Sheila
dashed the last teardrops away from
her eyes, caught up a bunch of violets
and fastened them at her throat, and
looked carefully to see if she “looked
as though she had been crying.”</p>

<p>She spent a few minutes removing
all traces of tears from her face, and by
that time all anger had subsided, and
she was ready to smile and be herself
again, though a little load lay upon the
background of her spirits. But no
message came to her from Cyril, and
she went restlessly out into the passage,
and along to the corridor of the modern
wing. Then she stood still and listened.</p>

<p>Effie’s door was close at hand, and it
stood just ajar, though the heavy curtain
veiled the room. Sheila heard a sound
of voices, and went a step nearer. Yes,
that was certainly Cyril’s voice, talking to
Effie. She bit her lip and stood hesitating.
Should she go in, or should she
not? Had it not been for her aunt’s
severe strictures she would never have
thought of staying away. She was lonely
by herself. And she wanted so much
to see Cyril. Yes, she would go in.
They could but send her away if they
did not want her.</p>

<p>The next moment she was within the
room, standing a moment hesitating
on the threshold. Cyril was sitting
beside Effie’s couch, talking kindly to
her as it seemed. Effie’s face looked
as though a storm had passed over it,
but she was smiling at Cyril, and when
both turned at the slight sound of Sheila’s
entrance she exclaimed quickly—</p>

<p>“Oh, come in. Cyril came to ask
whether you got forgiven for being late.
Did you get a scolding? Mother was
in a great state about your riding alone,
but I see you’ve got in all safe.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have,” answered Sheila
laughing, with a shy little look at Effie,
as much as to ask if she had forgiven
the plain speaking of the morning.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> “THE LADY DRESSMAKER.”</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who are interested in the protection of
birds, and object to their being killed to serve
as mere ornaments for hats and bonnets, will
be glad to read from the <i>New York Times</i> an
account of the recent inventions and changes
brought about by the great demand for
feathers for the decoration of masculine headgear
during the late war.</p>

<p>The trade in feathers amounts to many
millions of pounds annually, and the supply
of the birds furnishing them is decreasing
so rapidly, that it was essential that substitutes
should be found; and the American inventor
has proved himself equal to the occasion. The
supply of ostrich feathers from California is so
ample that it has brought the price of
feathers down to a reasonable figure, but still
not low enough for the low prices that are
asked for them. So there are plenty of good
ostrich feathers manufactured of celluloid, of
which the quills are made, while the barbs are
of silk waste. These are so skilfully dyed and
curled that only an expert could distinguish
them. Other expensive feathers and plumes
are made out of silk and cotton waste; and
enormous quantities of poultry feathers are
utilised, and are so exquisitely dyed and
painted that these imitation plumes are more
in demand than the real ones of the wild birds.
A remarkable machine has been invented, and
is in use for plucking the feathers from the
dead poultry, which strips them of their
feathers in just half a minute. Then the
plucked feathers are passed rapidly along to
another small room, where a current of air
sorts the very fine from the heavy ones; and
the very lightest and softest are used for
pillows; but all the others find some use in
the millinery trade. This state of things has
made poultry quite wonderfully profitable.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TWO SPRING GOWNS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first things I must mention are the
white muslin, and white and cream washing
silk blouses, which seem to be quite as
fashionable this year as they were at any time
during the last two years. They are made
this year chiefly with a very small bishop’s
sleeve and a tiny cuff. Tucks with lace
insertion between them seem to be the style,
when some form of yoke is not chosen. This
last way of making both dress bodices and
blouses is very evident in all the new models.
The shape is narrow and long, extending over
the shoulders, and tucks are the most popular
decoration. Lace insertion is also seen on
cambric and cotton shirts, and I notice that
vertical stripes are much used for all the
cambric ones. The muslin blouses have a
fitted under-bodice of muslin, or <i>batiste</i> in
colour, to wear underneath; and the skirt
should be of cashmere, to match this in colour.
The neck and waist-band may be of moire, or
of satin, either to match the skirt, or in white.
The latter, however, is said to make the waist
look large. In a sense, blouses are not as
fashionable as they were, for they are no longer
seen in the evening as they were. A pretty
evening gown, with the bodice and skirt alike,
is more distinctly in the last mode.</p>

<p>In the way of dresses, everything just now
seems to be of cloth, and very fine ones are
made up for evening dress. Many rows of
stitching seem to be the method of trimming
most followed; and strappings of the same
cloth for day dresses. Cashmeres and figured
mohairs, gauzes, and plenty of new grenadines
are in prominent view; the latter are beautiful
in their designs, floral patterns as well as
stripes being seen. Coloured silks will be
more worn than black ones, as under-dresses
for them; and I hear that deep flounces will
be the new way of making up.</p>

<p>It has always been a funny thing to me to
see the way in which men will bravely attack
the corset, and issue orders against it. These
attacks are made periodically, at intervals of
about eight or ten years; and all kinds of
accusations are hurled against the offending
corsets during the assault. But, like
Tennyson’s ever-quoted “Brook,” they go on
for ever. Here and there one may find some
woman who has dismissed them, but, as a
general rule, women are not much affected by
the clamour. Lately two fresh attacks have
been made, one by the Russian Minister of
Public Instruction, who, after paying many
visits to schools and gymnasia for girls, has
decided that the corset is not conducive to the
health of its wearers. So he has issued an
order to the pupils of the higher schools and
gymnasia, as well as to the students at the
Conservatories of music and art, prohibiting
the wearing of them, and with the order
goes a long paper, in which are the reasons for
the prohibition. At the same time, on the
other side of the Atlantic, a brave assemblyman
in Wisconsin, has introduced a resolution
into the State Legislature: “Resolved that
three members be appointed to form a committee
to draft a bill to protect the health of the
misses, old maids, and married women of the
State of Wisconsin, by making a law to prohibit
tight lacing.” Now, who is to find out the tight
lacers? One pities the police if they are to
perform these duties! And while I am
mentioning this, I must not forget to chronicle
that the new spring makes of corsets are
distinguished by straight fronts, the chief
shaping being done at the sides and hips.</p>

<p>The reign of the toque seems to be more
secure this spring than ever. Indeed, the
bonnet, <i>pure et simple</i>, with strings, is
nowhere, except for very elderly people.
<i>Plateaux</i> of straw and crinoline are much used
to pinch into any becoming style; and all
kinds of fancy straws in every hue are prepared
for toques. Many floral toques are seen, and
only one kind of flower is used to make them.
It has been quite remarkable this year how
early the most summery-looking hats have been
worn. Rose-covered ones were seen as early
as the beginning of March, and plenty of
white ones in the Park. All the new toques
are full and high in the front, with some
scraggy-looking tips straying upwards; and
to many people they are not becoming, the
essence of a toque being, I think, the snugness
and closeness of its fitting to the head.</p>

<p>In the way of colours for cloth costumes, I
see all shades of grey, stone and drab,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">{489}</a></span>
petunia, and blue of several shades, but I
should say that greys are the most popular.
Mauve toques and hats are really becoming a
kind of uniform; they are so much worn; and
every second woman wears violets.</p>

<p>It is said that all woollens will speedily become
more expensive as wool itself has gone
up; the reason of which lies in the prolonged
drought of last year. Cotton is also said to be
in the same case, and from the same reason.
Let us hope that this will not last long enough
to incommode us.</p>

<p>The two sitting figures in our illustration
show the prevalent styles of the present
spring. The one on the left wears a gown of
electric blue, and a short jacket with rounded
fronts. This and the narrow flounces on the
skirt are braided with black braid. The revers
on the jacket are of cream-coloured satin,
covered with cream lace. On the right hand,
the other sitting figure wears a purple cloth
dress, which is scalloped with white; the front
is of white cloth, with white lace at the neck.
The hat on the left is one of the newest ones,
with a square-topped crown, and the brims
slightly turned up on both sides.</p>

<img src="images/i_489b.jpg" width="325" height="540" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">IN SHEPHERD’S PLAID.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“In Shepherd’s Plaid” shows us one of
the prettiest of this season’s models, and so
youthful-looking that it will be becoming and
suitable for quite a young girl. It is made of
silk; the yoke of the bodice is of deep rose-coloured
silk, with <i>écru</i> lace edging. At the
top of the sleeves are bands to match, and the
rosy hue is repeated at the waist and at the
top of the flounces on the skirt, which are also
trimmed with two rows of black velvet. Black
velvet rosette bows are on the bodice. A
small white hat is worn with
white tulle trimmings and
white tips, and velvet bows
under the brim. It will be
seen that all the dresses worn
are slightly trained, and that
fashion has banished the comfortable
short skirt which we
have enjoyed for the past year.
From what I notice, however, some women
are not disposed to leave it off so easily, and I
daresay we shall see it made for really useful
gowns.</p>

<div class="figcenter w375">
<img src="images/i_489a.jpg" width="375" height="597" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE NEW BLACK VELVET JACKET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The new black velvet jacket is shown in our
next illustration; made in black velvet, very
short—as all the new jackets are—and
beautifully cut and fitted. These little jackets
have been so much the fashion in Paris that
we are sure to see many of them here, and
very useful they promise to be. The revers
are of white satin, and a ruffle of chiffon is
worn round the neck. The toque is of white
drawn tulle, with roses and white ostrich tips.
The second figure wears a grey cloth gown,
with a very short jacket, much pointed in the
front, which is crossed over, and fastens at the
side. The bodice is rounded out in front, the
opening being filled in with lace and chiffon.
The skirt and jacket are machine-stitched in
many rows, and have bows of ribbon velvet.
The hat is also a new shape, and is like the
one in the first sketch, but is rather more
sloping in the crown. The shapes of the
sleeves at the wrist are fully shown. They
are long and generally rounded, so as to fall
over the hands. These tulle and chiffon
ruffles are going, I think, to take the place of
the feather ones which we have worn for some
time. They are so pretty that the pity is
that they are so perishable, especially in our
grimy London. The tendency is so much
towards wearing white this year that our
purses will be quite depleted, if we are to
follow the fashion, and keep ourselves daintily
clean on all occasions.</p>

<p class="ph3">SABBATH AND REST.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>See, for that the Lord hath given you the
Sabbath.—Ex. xvi. 29.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of our last open evening, I
promised some of you, dear girl friends and
correspondents, that I would take Sunday and
Rest as the subject of one of our talks. I
find that the minds of many amongst you
are much exercised as to “the right way of
keeping Sunday.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad if you will some time
say a little about Sundays, and perhaps give us
some little rule to help us to keep them holy,”
wrote one. “People have such different ideas
about what is right and wrong to do on
Sunday.”</p>

<p>I do not wish to take that word “people”
in too wide a sense.</p>

<p>Our twilight gathering is a large one, and
now includes members of widely differing ages
and positions in life. I hope we all rejoice in
knowing that so many older friends have been
drawn within our circle, and are in full
sympathy with us.</p>

<p>Still, I love best of all to picture myself as
“the old mother sitting surrounded by a
countless family of girls, my adopted children
of the twilight hours,” and between whom and
myself links have been formed which will last
through the life of this world and beyond it.</p>

<p>During our talk I should like to use the old
sweet Bible word Sabbath, which can alone
suggest its real subject. I want us all to feel
its importance to ourselves as belonging to
those who profess and call themselves
Christians. We have not to consider how
those spend the day of rest who are living
without God in the world, and to whom the
Sabbath and its ordinances are less than
nothing; but how we can best use and enjoy
the privileges it brings, and help others to do
likewise.</p>

<p>What is the Sabbath?</p>

<p>If you were really within hearing, I could
imagine most of you would reply, “Why do
you ask such a question? Everybody knows
the difference between it and other days.”
And you would probably describe all its distinctive
features. The open churches, the
closed places of business, worshippers hurrying
in one direction, holiday-makers in another.
Or perhaps some would tell of joy experienced
in meeting with fellow Christians in the House
of God, or of happy family gatherings under
the home roof, impossible on other days, but
delightful on that precious day of rest.</p>

<p>After hearing all, and sympathising with
your joys, I should ask you to turn your
thoughts from the present, and go back with
me to the first chapter of the world’s history
for the answer to my question, “What is the
Sabbath? What was its beginning?”</p>

<p>It is God’s first gift to mankind, bestowed
when His work of Creation was completed by
the instalment of the first human pair in the
garden “eastward in Eden,” which He had
planted as a fitting abode for them.</p>

<p>The Divine Creator of the universe consecrated
the Sabbath by His example, and gave
it to be a continuous blessing throughout
endless ages.</p>

<p>It is beautiful to note the wisdom of God
in dealing with the first human pair, and the
lesson He taught them is for us to-day.
Paradise or Eden was not to be the abode of
idleness. By daily work <i>rest was to be earned</i>,
and only by means of work could rest be
enjoyed, and its preciousness realised in any
great degree.</p>

<p>I may note, in passing, that the idle, self-indulgent
time-killers are the persons who
complain most of weariness. They are tired
with doing nothing, yet not having earned the
right to rest, they cannot enjoy it.</p>

<p>People often allude to the Sabbath as if it
were a merely Jewish institution. Forgetting
the earliest Bible record, they dwell on
the time of Israel’s wanderings in the desert,
on the double supply of manna bestowed on
the sixth day to meet the wants of the seventh
also; the disobedience of some, and the words
which followed, addressed by the Lord to
Moses:</p>

<p>“See, for that the Lord hath given you the
Sabbath, therefore He giveth you on the sixth
day the bread of two days.” The Fourth
Commandment, given from Mount Sinai, and
engraved on stone, was the renewal and confirmation
of that first inestimable gift of a day
of rest.</p>

<p>Now, dear ones, I want you to think how a
gift can alone fulfil the giver’s object in
bestowing it. It must be willingly and
gratefully accepted, valued, and used in
accordance with the intentions of the giver.</p>

<p>Even gifts are often received without being
welcome, and for various reasons. We may
fear to cause pain by refusing them, or we
may be afraid of future loss if we do so. We
may dislike the idea of being indebted to the
person who offers the gift. The article itself
may be one on which we set no value, and so
on. Or, as often happens, gifts are prized at
first for their novelty, then unused, hidden
away and forgotten, together with the giver.</p>

<p>I have a very dear friend who is constantly
receiving tokens of affectionate remembrance.
He is one who never loses an opportunity of
brightening a dark path or smoothing a rough
one, of helping to relieve an overweighted
back of some part of its burden, of saying a
cheery or comforting word, or of doing a
kindness at the right time and in the right
way—always an unostentatious one.</p>

<p>This is a great deal to say of any man, but
how delightful to be able to say it with
absolute truth! Many of the little souvenirs
that reach my friend are of small intrinsic
value and seem almost out of place amongst
the beautiful ornaments and works of art in
his home. But whenever the donor of the
humblest gift is a guest in that house, the
little token of affection or gratitude is sure to
be in evidence, and the sight of it adds to the
pleasure of host and visitor. The former can
only show a small number of these carefully-kept
presents at one time, but they come
out in turns, and prove that none have been
thrown aside or forgotten.</p>

<p>Probably what I have said of my friend has
put a new thought into the minds of many of
you, and I hope it has suggested a way of
giving pleasure to the humblest friend, which
may not have struck you before. Above all, I
trust it will lead each of you to ask, “Have I
thankfully accepted, valued, and used in the
right way God’s first precious gift of one day
in seven for the rest and refreshment of mind
and body, and the good of my soul?”</p>

<p>No mere rule will ever make any of us use
this gift worthily. We must rejoice in it as a
part of our divine inheritance. Surely, when
we think that God has given us life and breath
and all things, that from Him every good and
perfect gift has come, a new glow of glad
thankfulness should fill our hearts, as we
remember that He did not omit to fix the
periodical day of rest.</p>

<p>Well for us, dear ones, that we were not
left to depend on any ordinance of man for
the right to this blessing. Think what the
world would be without it! The Sabbath is
often abused, ignored, neglected, almost
always undervalued. But would the most
careless, or even the most irreligious, like it to
be wholly abolished?</p>

<p>I daresay some, probably most, of you have
read that amongst the horrors of the French
Revolution the Sabbath was abolished together
with all the services of religion.</p>

<p>I do not wish to enter into detail or to
picture the horrible scenes which followed,
but as there is a tendency amongst a large
class of persons to undervalue the Sabbath in
its hallowed character, it is well for us to
glance at the state of France during its
abolition. Listen to a few words only. “The
services of religion were now universally abandoned.
The pulpits were deserted through
all the revolutionised districts; baptisms
ceased; the burial service was no longer
heard; the sick received no Communion; the
dying no consolation. A heavier anathema
than that of papal power pressed upon the
peopled realm of France—the anathema of
Heaven, inflicted by the madness of her own
inhabitants. The village bells were silent;
Sunday was obliterated; infancy entered the
world without a blessing; age left it without
a hope. On every tenth day a revolutionary
leader ascended the pulpit and preached
Atheism to the bewildered audience. On all
the public cemeteries the inscription was placed,
‘Death is an eternal sleep.’”</p>

<p>I should not like to shock your ears or to
leave with one of our twilight gatherings such
memories as would haunt you, were I to continue
my quotation; so I have only given a
faint glimpse of a country without a Sabbath
and its gracious Giver. May the little help us
to realise more fully the preciousness of His
first gift to mankind.</p>

<p>I wonder if you, my dear girl friends, have
ever thought of a fact which establishes the
Divine origin of the Sabbath. You know
how we measure our years, calendar months
and days, and how these periods are accounted
for by the journeying of the earth round the
sun, and other movements and positions which
regularly recur. But there is nothing to divide
week from week, or to mark a definite period
of seven days, save the Divine example and
the Divine command, as recorded in the
Bible.</p>

<p>The story of God’s creative work during six
days, and of His resting and sanctifying the
seventh, the commandment, “Six days shalt
thou labour and do all thy work, but the
seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God,” are our only warrant for the division of
time which we call a week. The lunar
month divided by four will not give fully
seven days. The calendar months are of
unequal lengths, and even the year cannot be
divided into so many exact weeks.</p>

<p>This fact may be already known to most of
you, but you may have gone over the figures
many a time without saying to yourselves,
“The movements of the earth and her attendant
moon mark various periods, but never an
exact term of seven days. For this division
we must refer to God’s word and His command
to give six days to work and the seventh
to rest.”</p>

<p>Are you saying to yourselves that I am
dwelling too long on the institution itself,
whereas you want to know how best to keep
it in these days of varied opinions and many
temptations? Forgive me if I have stepped
aside a little from the path you asked me to
tread. I longed—I cannot tell you how
earnestly—to impress upon your minds, first of
all, a sense of God’s love in bestowing the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">{491}</a></span>
of rest and the infinite benevolence it manifests.
We can neither value nor use such a gift as
we ought to do, unless we feel that it was
bestowed for our good and to make us both
better and happier. Having once realised
this, how can we help thanking God for it
and feeling anxious to use it aright, so that
we may derive from it all the benefit intended
for us?</p>

<p>Most people, however irreligious and indifferent
to the sanctified part of the Sabbath,
practically acknowledge it as the best day of
the seven. If they do not, why should it be
the day for clean raiment, for the best clothes
to be worn, the best food to be provided, and
all done that can be done, according to the
lights of different individuals, to make it stand
out as being unlike the other six days?</p>

<p>It ought to be the brightest and happiest
day of the week, and I, for one, have no
sympathy with those who would make it a
day of gloom and weariness to the young.
On the other hand, I have as little sympathy
with those who would leave God out of it, and
dedicate it wholly to what they call pleasure,
but which often results in over-wearied bodies,
unrefreshed souls and unfitness to begin the
work of the six days that follow.</p>

<p>To enjoy our Sabbath we must feel glad of
and thankful for it, and we shall not be
satisfied unless our immortal part is refreshed
and strengthened, as well as our body, by the
opportunities it gives.</p>

<p>We shall need no special command, no
hard and fast rule to direct us. Our grateful
hearts will incline us to turn our steps towards
the house of God once during the day, if it be
possible for us to do so. And, if not, we can
mark the day in the quiet of home by devoting
an hour to special study of God’s word, prayer,
thanksgiving and self-examination.</p>

<p>There are many waking hours in our day.
Let us ask ourselves whether, when prevented
from joining in public worship, we habitually
dedicate one in the way I have named.</p>

<p>I once heard a girl say, “I do like to take
a bit of Sunday to talk myself over.”</p>

<p>It was her way of alluding to her weekly
self-examination, and, whilst feeling conscious
that I needed to “look within” much more
frequently, I rejoiced to hear from young lips
that the “talking herself over” was habitual.</p>

<p>Supposing that circumstances prevent one
visit to the house of God, and there are only
mother and daughter, mistress and maid, in
the house, why should not these claim and
enjoy the blessing promised in the words of
Jesus, “For where two or three are gathered
together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them”?</p>

<p>I know by experience how very sweet and
profitable such household services can be,
even when there are literally only the two or
three to share in them. And how very small
is the fragment they take out of the day of
rest, whilst sweetening and purifying the whole
of it.</p>

<p>If our Sunday observances are not influenced
by thankfulness for God’s gift, anxiety to use
it rightly, and love for the Giver, they are
generally fitful and, to a great extent, dependent
on our immediate surroundings. For
instance, when we are at home we may be
regular in our attendance at church. We
should feel ashamed were the friends who
worship under the same roof with us to see
our seats vacant week after week from any
cause except illness or absence from home.
Are we equally regular in our attendance
when amongst strangers, or in a new neighbourhood?
When taking holiday, do we not
sometimes regard it as part of the holiday to
excuse ourselves from going to church and
say, “We want the fresh air and change of
scene. We must make the most of our
opportunities.” By so doing we show plainly
that there is no heart in our ordinary worship,
no realisation of the value of the Sabbath, or
the needs of our spiritual nature.</p>

<p>I heard some young people talking together
of a Continental tour they were about to take
and the pleasure it would give them. They
were unused to travel and were discussing the
amount of luggage they must take: what
articles must go, what could be done without.</p>

<p>An old friend listened to them with interest
and amusement. He had travelled much and
wished that he could renew past pleasure by
witnessing the enjoyment of these bright girls
amid new scenes and experiences. His
opinion was often asked as to what might be
called necessaries and what luxuries. At length
he said—</p>

<p>“I have noticed that so many people forget
one thing which they seem to value at home,
but leave behind, though they could take it
with them and have no extra cost for luggage.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” was the eager question.</p>

<p>“Sunday.”</p>

<p>No other word was needed. The girls
understood their old friend’s meaning. They
had heard their travelled acquaintances speak
of Sundays spent in other lands, and knew
how easily they had been induced to fall in
with the ways of those amongst whom they
found themselves.</p>

<p>One of yourselves told me that when abroad
last summer the party of tourists found there
was no English service in the town where
they were, so it was settled they should travel
on Sunday to their next stopping-place.
“I,” wrote my girl friend, “had kept the last
month’s Twilight Talk to read in the train at
the time that, had I been in England, I should
have been at church.” Then she related an
incident that followed and brought with it a
temptation to do something which would
have put self before others; but, she added,
“with the words I had been reading fresh in
my mind, I had the strength to overcome my
selfishness.”</p>

<p>It was very delightful to know that, even
when so far from home, a dear member of our
circle had been influenced for good by reading
our last talk, and I am sure she will forgive
my quoting this little incident, because it will
give pleasure to us all and be helpful also.</p>

<p>You no doubt remember the Bible phrase,
“a Sabbath day’s journey,” which surely
suggests Sunday travelling, you will say.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how often we hear an
expression without finding out its meaning, so
there may be some of you who do not know
that a Sabbath day’s journey meant seven and
a half furlongs, rather less than a mile.</p>

<p>Now, in these days it would be impossible
to confine travelling to such narrow limits,
but I do venture to protest against the needless
journeying on Sunday, which helps to
keep many people at work who sorely need
the day of rest that God ordained for them.</p>

<p>When, many years ago, the dear partner of
my happiest days and I were travelling
together, we always rested on the Sunday, if
possible, in some place where we could attend
church; if not, where we could spend the
day peacefully, and claim the blessing promised
to the “two or three.” We reaped the benefit,
when we resumed our journey, in the sense of
freshness and vigour, which gave keener enjoyment
to every new scene and experience.</p>

<p>Apart from all religious sentiment, we were
in these abundantly repaid for our observance
of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>I have more to say on this subject, but it
must wait until our next meeting, when we
will take such glimpses of the Sabbaths of
Jesus as the Bible gives us in the picture of
His Manhood. We shall also have more to
say about “Rest.”</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> ISABELLA FYVIE MAYO, Author of “Other People’s Stairs,” “Her Object in Life,” etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p class="ph3">ON A HEIGHT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last the “final word” before the
silence came in form of a telegram—“Safe
on board. This will be despatched
by pilot on his return. All well.” The exhilaration
of feeling that the great scheme
was really put a-working carried Lucy
over the first consciousness that the
silence had begun. Besides, next day
there came another alleviation in a
kindly letter from Mrs. Grant, the
captain’s wife, who wrote that she
thought Lucy might like to hear the
very latest news of her husband—as she
always did, of the captain. She narrated
that she and her husband had thought
Mr. Challoner looking wonderfully well,
considering the great illness he had
had, that he would have been in the
very best of spirits, if only he had not
been leaving his wife and boy behind.
She added that, for her own part, she
was delighted that her husband should
have the boon of Mr. Challoner’s
company. The captain was always
glad of a pleasant companion, but could
seldom hope to secure the society of an
old and valued friend such as Mr.
Challoner was. She ended by saying
that she would not fail to let Lucy have
any item of news which might reach her
concerning the ship, and could trust
Lucy would do the same towards her,
especially as Lucy would surely get
long letters from Mr. Challoner at every
opportunity; whereas “the captain”
was often too busy to send anything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">{492}</a></span>
the briefest line, and was but a poor
correspondent at best.</p>

<p>All this, of course, cheered Lucy
greatly, as does always the sympathy of
those whose interests are bound up with
our own, or at least allied to them.
There was also plenty to do. Every
housewife knows how her household
runs down from the lofty paths of order
and precision when there is illness in
the home, and everything has to give
way to the preservation of a beloved life.
Then, too, while her memory of the
golden days at Deal was still fresh, Lucy
wanted to finish the sketches she had
made there. She had always her great
ambition, to wit, that by her own work,
her teaching and her sketches, she
might be able “to keep the house
going” without trenching at all on the
little store—their all—which Charlie had
left with her. It would be so cheering
to him to come home and begin life
again not a bit poorer than when he
went away. While she could do something
for Charlie, he seemed not so
far off!</p>

<p>Florence Brand appeared less helpful
than she had promised to be in securing
a servant. She sent Lucy two or three
girls from sundry registry offices. Lucy
was not much attracted to any of them.
One wore long plumes; another had
taken a seat in the parlour and did not
even rise, as any guest would do, when
Mrs. Challoner entered. Lucy was
really relieved when she found that they
all asked higher wages than she had
given while Mr. Challoner was at home—a
point which it was, of course,
impossible to concede. When she
mentioned this to her sister, Florence
said—</p>

<p>“Oh, well, they were the nicest of the
girls I saw, and I didn’t think a pound
or two need make any difference. It is
often economy in the end.”</p>

<p>“I know that perfectly,” Lucy answered.
“But it would be preposterous
for me, under my present circumstances,
to pay more for service for two than I
have ever paid for service for three.
There will be so much less to do. We
shall never have two sitting-rooms going
at once as we often had when Charlie
had evening work; nor late dinner, as
we were obliged to have for him coming
from his office; nor an occasional hot
supper as we had when he could not get
home in time for dinner. It will be a
very easy place.”</p>

<p>“Used Pollie to do your washing?”
asked Florence meditatively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lucy. “She had a
weekly small wash. Charlie always
wore flannel shirts, so there were only
collars and cuffs to starch. Then once
a month we had a heavier wash, and a
woman came to help. There is a nice
little laundry at the back, so that the
steam does not go through the house.”</p>

<p>“Servants don’t like doing washing
nowadays,” observed Florence.</p>

<p>“Should I come across a nice girl
who would agree to take lower wages if
I put out most of the things, I would
agree to the plan,” Lucy answered.
“I will agree to any arrangement which
will not cost me more money, for that I
absolutely cannot afford.”</p>

<p>“‘Generals’ are so scarce nowadays,”
said Mrs. Brand. “A good
‘general’ in a house is as hard to get
as a good General in the field. That’s
how the saying goes. To get cooks
and housemaids is possible. It’s easier
still if parlourmaid and nurse are kept.
The more the merrier, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“But a general servant is what I
want,” returned Lucy, rather stiffly.
“Not necessarily a ‘thorough’ one—except
in character. Apart from that,
I will accept mere cleanliness and
willingness.”</p>

<p>She could scarcely keep from adding
that Florence’s own experience of a
crowd of servants had not seemed so
satisfactory as to tempt her into the
same lines, even if that were possible.
Yet Mrs. Brand’s remarks made her
sister uneasy. She began to realise
that she would have to place far more
confidence in the stranger that should
come within her gates than she had
ever reposed in the long-familiar Pollie.
She had trained Pollie. She had always
supervised her. She had given considerable
help. Much of this would be
impossible now she herself was to be the
bread-winner of the household.</p>

<p>She began to realise, too, that for the
first time she confronted the difficulties
of modern housekeeping. Hitherto,
everything had been idyllic. Of course,
Pollie had made mistakes sometimes,
especially at first, but she had been
always willing to learn, honest as sunlight,
and clean with rural cleanliness.
When Lucy had heard the perpetual
grumble and bewailing of the mistresses
among her acquaintance, she had, in
her secret heart, been inclined to think
there was a great deal in the adage
“Good mistresses make good servants,”
which was often openly and severely
enunciated by dignified old dames
supported by retainers of twenty or
thirty years’ standing. Also she had
recognised the defects of her sister
Florence’s household management, at
once so exacting and so careless. She
had owned to herself that if she were a
servant, she would not wish to remain
in the Brand establishment.</p>

<p>Now she felt, however, that she was
driven out upon slippery places, where
Florence, however unsuccessful in keeping
her feet, yet had some experience
where she herself had none. Yet Lucy
might have been wiser to have tried
her experiments after her own fashion.
But a woman happily married and then
suddenly deprived of her husband’s
counsel and decision, is only too ready
to lean upon any reed which offers itself
to her hand, especially when her mind
is distracted by duties which seem to
her of paramount importance.</p>

<p>No suitable maiden had presented
herself when Pollie’s departing day
arrived. But Mrs. Brand, far from
being disconcerted by this, had been
thinking it an advisable course of circumstances,
and ignoring all Lucy’s
wishes in the contrary direction.</p>

<p>“I should prefer to have the two girls
here together for a day or two,” Lucy
had pleaded; “then the newcomer
would see just what was expected from
her.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Mrs. Brand with
decision. “Never allow your old servant
and your new one to meet. Even
in my house, it is always a comfort when
there is a regular clearance. The old
ones put the stranger up to all your
weaker points, tell them just where they
can deceive you, and the demands they
would advise them to make, ‘if they
would begin as they would like to go
on.’ Consequently you never really have
even the brief advantage of ‘the new
broom that sweeps well.’”</p>

<p>“I cannot regard Pollie as a natural
enemy,” Lucy answered. “I feel sure
she would say the place is a good one,
that we are not ill to live with, and that
a girl who could not get on with us must
be hard to please.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brand laughed gaily.</p>

<p>“Will you ever learn wisdom, my
dear?” she said. “You persist in
judging Pollie by yourself. But would
you have treated anybody as she has
just treated you?—suddenly casting
off an old tie precisely at a critical
time?”</p>

<p>“Yet it is certainly for a great event
in her life,” replied Lucy. “Of course,
I feel that in her place I should have
acted differently. For one thing, I hate
secrecy, and if Pollie had told me of
her future intentions the moment they
were decided (as I told her of mine), and
had not resolved to make the great jump
at a moment’s notice, as it were, without
any reference to us, then I think there
might have been very little trouble in
the adjusting of our interests. She
might have seen me well over my
sorrows and difficulties without much
hindrance of her own happiness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brand broke into explosions of
merriment.</p>

<p>“Pollie and her future intentions!”
she echoed. “I daresay she met the
man only the week before! With these
people, we waste our judgments in quite
wrong directions.”</p>

<p>“Pollie told me she had known the
man for years,” said Lucy.</p>

<p>“Oh, they always say that,” returned
Mrs. Brand. “Their ‘knowing’ means
that they have seen the man in the
street, or in some shop, or, at best, at
their chapel. Pollie was a great hand
at chapel-going. I always thought there
was something at the bottom of it.
Then as for her ‘happiness,’ if these
girls knew what was good for them,
they wouldn’t marry at all. In less than
a year’s time, she will wish she hadn’t.
Very likely she will come and tell you
so. She will come with a black eye,
and a baby in her arms, and she will own
she would be glad to come back to you,
if it wasn’t for that baby! That has
happened to me more than once.”</p>

<p>“Flo, Flo,” cried Lucy, her own heart
soft with tender remembrance of her
absent husband, “do you think that
nobody can be loving and happy save
the wealthy and leisurely?”</p>

<p>“I’m not blaming the poor wretches,
I’m sure,” Flo defended herself. “If
Jem and I had to live in one room, I
should not wonder much if he beat me
sometimes. He’s cross enough often;
but then I can leave him to himself.
What would he get like, fancy, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">{493}</a></span>
saw me worn out with cleaning up and
nursing, and dressed in rags? When
all that comes in at the door, love goes
out at the window. Pollie will soon find
there is a great difference between
workaday reality and the courting
times of her evenings out and bank
holidays.”</p>

<p>“Well, the love that cannot sustain
any conditions that life imposes, has
never been love at all. So it is not much
loss when it goes!” said Lucy, with an
indignant note in her voice. She felt
keenly how her own position looked in
such eyes as those of Florence and Jem
Brand.</p>

<p>“Ah, you live in the grand style—in
blank verse, I may say,” Flo went on
carelessly. “But that was never my
way. Perhaps, after all, each gets
what each most cares for. I should
not have married Jem, perhaps, if I had
been of the blank verse style. But here
we are, wandering off into the fields of
romance. The business in hand is, let
Pollie go. Engage your washerwoman—you
say you have one once a month—to
come to you every day till you
are suited. Then you’ll get at the
bottom of all Pollie’s little ways,
and will find out what kitchen things
you have really got, and what is gone
past recovery, down the sink or up the
chimney. You can make out new lists,
and then the minute you see a suitable
girl, there’s the place ready for her, and
so she starts fair.”</p>

<p>Lucy resented all Mrs. Brand’s doubts
of Pollie. She could not see why a
single act of inconsideration and rashness
should so condemn character, root
and branch, in a servant, when the same
would be easily condoned in a friend or
relative, and possibly even regarded as
rather pretty and romantic; simply
another illustration of “all for love and
the world well lost.” She knew young
men and women, too, who had treated
their own parents quite as thoughtlessly
as Pollie had treated her master’s household.
Lucy had always regarded such
conduct with great severity, whereas
Flo had only laughed over it, retailing
“delicious” incidents of how the “old
folks” had been “sold.” This was
but another instance of higher standards
of conduct being set for the kitchen than
for the drawing-room. It had always
seemed to Lucy’s chivalrous nature to be
a gross injustice that, from those members
of society who are presumed, conventionally,
to have had the fewest “advantages,”
more should be expected than
from those who are said to have had
“every advantage.” She could not
understand it, not yet having learned that
this injustice, like all injustice, is rooted
in sheer selfishness. Many people care
nothing at all for “rights and wrongs”
save as these affect their own personal
convenience. Many more are seldom
brought even to consider “rights and
wrongs” until these reach the same
point.</p>

<p>Alas, our household state would be
actually worse than it is, were not our
servants in a general way, at least, more
punctual and more “tidy” than many
of ourselves!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Lucy’s instinctive
abhorrence of so many of her sister’s
domestic standpoints, she yet accepted
Mrs. Brand’s advice as to letting Pollie
go and having a charwoman interregnum.
Indeed, as no other alternative offered,
she was forced to accept it.</p>

<p>Pollie went off, tearful and subdued,
and full of humbly-expressed hopes
“that the master would come back
quite strong.”</p>

<p>“It would have troubled him terribly
to know you were leaving me just now,
Pollie,” said Lucy, sufficiently reconciled
to be able to show the wound to the
hand which had dealt it. “I believe
he would have deferred going away.
Yet this is the right season for him to
go—to say nothing of the opportunity
of going with a good friend. You
have made me keep a secret from my
husband, Pollie, for the very first time,
and the bare thought of it makes me
unhappy!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the sort o’ secret the
angels in heaven must keep for us all!”
cried Pollie, who had “Irish blood” on
the mother’s side which moved when
she was deeply stirred. “Sure, there’s
many a thing they must see hanging
over our heads that they just manage
for us with never a word or a sign, and
we never knowing what we should thank
them for!”</p>

<p>“Well, Pollie,” said her mistress,
“let me hear of you sometimes, I shall
be always glad to get good news of you,
and you may care to know how we
get on.”</p>

<p>Pollie looked grave.</p>

<p>“There’s no fear but you’ll do well
enough, ma’am,” she said, with an
emphasis on the personal pronoun,
which was not without significance in a
prospective bride. “There’s many a
girl would jump sky high to get into
such a place. An’ I’d never have left
you for any other missis.”</p>

<p>Lucy felt very lonely when she found
herself left in the house with only little
Hugh. The charwoman would come
early in the morning, but would sleep in
her own home as she had sons “to
look after.” Lucy put Hugh to bed,
heard him say his little prayer for dear
papa, and talked about ships to him till
he fell asleep, hugging a wooden rabbit
which was Pollie’s parting gift. Then
Lucy went wandering through the empty
rooms. Pollie had left everything in
“apple-pie” order. The pathetic traces
of Charlie’s illness and convalescence
were all cleared away. The kitchen, too,
was neat and trim. Lucy mechanically
pulled out the drawers, and set open
the cupboard doors. All was as it
should be, and Lucy was deeply thankful
that Pollie had left behind no further
disappointment in herself. For the
hushed heart of yearning sorrow and
anxiety shrinks from those squalid revelations
of human nature, which torture it
much as vermin might torment a helpless
invalid.</p>

<p>Under the infliction of Pollie’s bustle
and Mrs. Brand’s chatter, Lucy had
actually longed for this quiet hour. She
had craved for the silence and the
solitude in which it had seemed to her
that her spirit might get nearer to the
absent Charlie. For a brief spell there
was sweetness in it, but it was not long
before she felt that it might become a
perilous and painful luxury. When she
had gone through the house, giving
here and there the little touch which
must be always left for the hand of the
mistress, and when there was absolutely
nothing more to do that night, then she
found that she realised not so much any
spiritual communion with Charlie, as
the silence and separation which lay
between them.</p>

<p>“I have been wrong,” she said to
herself. “I have been fancying lately
that the peculiar weight of my cross lay
in the need for bearing it together with
petty money cares, and with work for
which one must brace oneself up, and
shut away one’s mere personal feelings.
Now I begin to see that these are less
added weights than props on which
from time to time the burden of a great
trial may rest till it is almost lifted from
one’s own strength.”</p>

<p>“We are taught, too,” she went on
musingly, “that we can best approach
God and serve Him by our service to
others—the simple service which comes
naturally out of our living and working
among them. Does it not, therefore,
seem reasonable that in the same fashion
we may also best approach and serve
those whom we love—the parted—or
the dead?” and Lucy’s lips quivered.
“It is the day’s hard work, too, which
gives the sweet sleep and the good
dreams! How absurd it sounds to put
into words what is really the wonderful
discovery that one makes, sooner or
later (though one is always forgetting
it!), to wit, that God knows what is best
for His children, and that if they keep
in His ways, they shall find the food
and the tasks that are the most ‘convenient’
for them.”</p>

<p>“I thank Thee, my Father,” she
said aloud, clasping her hands together
as she stood in the shadowy little parlour,
“I thank Thee that Thou hast filled my
hands with duties so that I need have
no empty hour. I thank Thee that my
love for Charlie may run, woven into
my love for Thee, through all my work
and all my thoughts—the golden thread,
which binds all together into a chaplet,
not indeed meet to present to Thee, yet
which Thou wilt accept, because it is Thy
daughter’s offering. And I thank Thee—oh,
how I thank Thee!—for the little
child Thou hast given me, to whom I
must be, for a while, both mother and
father too. And, Father, be with
Charlie in his ship tossing on Thy seas.
Give him sweet sleep and happy dreams.
Make him feel assured that all is well—with
Hugh and me.” She paused; she
could not bring herself to pray. “Bring
him home safely, if it be Thy will.”
She could only say, “Father, we are in
Thy will, and there we are safe—and
together—always!”</p>

<p>Nobody was there to see her then, or
they would have marked the shining of
her face—for she had been with God.
But such mounts of transfiguration rise
abruptly from the broil and bicker of
life’s dusty plain, and often it is when we
descend from them that we encounter
the demons!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GIRLS_OWN_QUESTIONS_AND_ANSWERS_COMPETITION" id="THE_GIRLS_OWN_QUESTIONS_AND_ANSWERS_COMPETITION">THE GIRL’S OWN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS COMPETITION.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Who are the Prize-Winners and Certificate-Holders?</span></p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Examiners: JAMES MASON and the EDITOR.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are no girls more engaging than those
who are trying to do or to be something of
value, and having said that, our opinion may be
inferred of the numerous company who have
worked so diligently during the three months
of this interesting competition. It has
been an affair of “long breath,” and has
proved this, if it has proved anything, that our
girls are of the right sort.</p>

<p>That it has been enjoyed is clear from many
letters received from competitors. “It has
taken up a good deal of time,” writes one
girl, “but the time has been well spent, because
the questions asked were of real value,
and to be able to answer at least the greater
number of them, might be regarded as a
general test of our being well informed.”</p>

<p>The competition was chiefly a lesson in the
art of hunting up information, an art always of
service. The questions were not to be replied
to by guess-work, or by the exercise of a ready
imagination. In the preparation of their
papers, girls learned how to make good use of
books of reference, and some communicative
ones have told us that they have thereby
gained a clearer notion than they ever entertained
before of the value of such works as the
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, Chambers’s <i>Encyclopædia</i>,
Haydn’s <i>Dictionary of Dates</i>, Dr.
Brewer’s <i>Phrase and Fable</i>, the <i>Imperial
Dictionary</i>, and Chambers’s <i>Book of Days</i>.</p>

<p>We noticed that <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>
volumes had proved to many a perfect library
of knowledge and, indeed, it is not too much
to say that a diligent study of the back
numbers of this periodical would have enabled
anyone to answer nearly all the questions
without consulting any other work whatever.</p>

<p>A pleasing feature in the competition was
that girls, as a general rule, improved as they
went on. One who had a third-class place at
the start would end in the second rank, and a
second-class girl would become a first. This
is as it should be. Few—hardly any—began
well and then relapsed into inaccuracy and
carelessness.</p>

<p>A good number—but not so many as we
expected—failed to send in all the three
instalments of papers. Sometimes, perhaps,
they grew tired, and sometimes illness and
circumstances over which they had not control
may have prevented them. These, of course—if
they have obtained a place at all—have not got
so good a place as if they had replied, or tried
to reply, to the whole seventy-two questions.</p>

<p>The most important feature of the answers
was accuracy, and both in that and in the
manner in which the sense was expressed,
competitors did very well indeed. Where the
answers admitted of a difference of opinion, we
saw many signs of intelligence and of a desire
to think and investigate for oneself that cannot
be too strongly commended and encouraged.</p>

<p>Occasionally girls were rather sparing of
their words. Brevity may be the soul of wit,
but it does not quench one’s thirst for information.
A yes, a no, a name, or a date,
neither makes entertaining reading nor forms
a sufficient test of a girl’s knowledge of the
subject under discussion. But we have
nothing but praise for a girl—though she did
not win a certificate—who says, “I have not
given long answers, but I have done my best.”</p>

<p>We said that neatness would count, and in
some cases the want of it was what told
against a girl, turning the scale and landing
her in a class lower than she would otherwise
have occupied.</p>

<p>What reasonable excuse can be given for
one who writes, with perhaps careless penmanship,
on paper of all sizes, and of different
colours too, and with rough edges, as if it
had been torn in the rudest manner out of a
copybook? If our untidy friends went to call
on a stranger, they would surely wish to look
smart, and by looking smart to create a good
impression. Now, sending even a scrap of
paper to anyone—let it be a letter or anything
else—to which our name is attached is just
like paying a visit. What we send should be
made to look as neat as we ourselves would
wish to be if we went in person.</p>

<p>We do not say that a good paper in this
competition was invariably a neat one, or that
originality and freshness had not sometimes
an untidy appearance, but the general rule
was that if a girl had taken real pains, she
showed it in the manner in which she turned
out her work, as well as in the matter.</p>

<p>A bit of ribbon, a paper-fastener, an illuminated
letter, the ruling of a line, the folding
of a page—these may be trifles, but we are
judged by trifles when there is no other means
of judging. So, you girls who have occasioned
these remarks—only a few in number you
were—be very careful next time.</p>

<p>Here is another weak point. Why don’t
some girls obey rules? The papers were to be
fastened together—see the rules—and some
did not fasten them. They were to be
fastened at the left-hand top corner—see the
rules—and some did it on the right. The
name was to be put on the back of the last
page of each instalment—see the rules—and
some put it on the front page. Names and
ages were to be given—see the rules—and no
fewer than twenty papers failed to find a place
because their writers had omitted one or other
of these two important particulars.</p>

<p>We want our girls to be models of common
sense, and does not common sense suggest
that by obeying instructions we get more
consideration than if we do not? It is only a
bit of worldly wisdom, girls, for all who take
part in competitions, that you ought to try to
keep examiners in a genial humour. Never
ruffle their patience if you can avoid it.
Sometimes a little neglect gives a good deal
of trouble that ought to have been saved.
However, we shall let defaulters off this time
with a caution that if they ever appear before
our High Court again on a similar charge, we
shall be a great deal more severe.</p>

<p>The most difficult task connected with the
competition has been laid on the shoulders of
the examiners, for much painstaking has
been required to decide as to the merits of
papers where so many were good, so few
second-rate, and such a trifling number meriting
nothing but a “Let us try to do better next
time.” The result of our examination is given
in the following list of successful competitors,
in which will be found the names of all the
prize-winners and certificate-holders.</p>

<p>[<i>Note</i>: Two girls under the age at which
the competition began, and fifteen over the
age at which it terminated, sent in papers.
To one of the two juniors, and to two of the
fifteen seniors, a certificate has been awarded.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Girls</span>,—I have read with much
pleasure the large number of essays sent in by
readers of “The Deaf Girl” because almost
all of them show such a thorough appreciation
of, and sympathy with, the purpose of the
story. I am sorry to disqualify seventeen,
from disregard of the rule that they must
confine themselves to one page of foolscap
only. A great many pass over the more
important incidents of the story and give
undue prominence to details. Others again
dilate too much on the first part of the book,
and have to crowd the latter. But I heartily
thank all who express sympathy with my object
and a desire to aid the afflicted class of whom
I write. If I could induce one or two of you
even to become workers (so much needed) in
this service, I should indeed rejoice, and feel
that my little story has accomplished its end.</p>

<h2><a name="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS" id="ANSWERS_TO_CORRESPONDENTS">ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</a></h2>


<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Orient</span> asks us for “a method of permanently removing
fat from her nose.” But as she says
“sometimes it disappears altogether, and at other
times it becomes very thick,” we can tell her for
certain that her nose does not get swollen from a
deposit of fat. When fat deposits in the nose, it
comes to stay. Let her use an ointment of calamine
or ichthiol, and attend to her digestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madge.</span>—Colour blindness is an incurable condition.
It is congenital and frequently hereditary. There
are various grades of the affection. The three
primary colours (physiological) are red, green, and
violet, and there is a separate set of nervous cells
to appreciate each of these primary colours. In
colour blindness one or more of these sets of cells
are absent. Thus colour-blind persons are blind
to red, to green, or to violet, or to two or all of
these. Total colour blindness is uncommon. Very
frequently the subjects of colour blindness are
quite ignorant of their condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worried.</span>—Read the answer to “Orient.” Though
indigestion is the commonest cause of red noses,
there are other causes such as diseases of the nose
and feeble circulation. In your case undoubtedly
the chief factor at work is the last. You should
dress yourself warmly, and always wear a veil when
you go out for a walk. Take a nutritious but
easily digestible diet with plenty of warm milk.
Always wash in warm water. Locally you may use
the ichthiol ointment or a little cold cream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our Girls’ Brother.</span>—The question of the intermarrying
of cousins is a very important one, and
deserves a little consideration. The whole question
turns upon hereditary tendency. Let us take
an example. Miss Smith is going to marry Mr.
Jones. The woman brings to the union the hereditary
tendencies and the family peculiarities of the
Smith family. Mr. Jones brings those of the Jones
family. The future Master Jones will inherit the
tendencies of both his parents, and his mind may
be represented as partaking of the following, “self-Jones-Smith.”
That is to say, he has inherited
something from the Jones family and something
from the Smith family to add to his own original
self, which, of course, is far the most important
item. But suppose these persons who are going to
marry are cousins: here there is only one family’s
tendencies to be inherited, so their offsprings will
get a little less to inherit, but the tendencies which
they do inherit, being derived from both parents,
will be very much more marked. The result of the
constant intermarriage of relatives is to strengthen
the family tendencies, and to render the minds of
the future generations one-sided but not, if the
family is a healthy one, incompetent. So there is
little or nothing against the intermarriage of
cousins once or perhaps twice. And there would
be but little against constant intermarriage in a
family which was absolutely healthy, which in the
human race is practically impossible. Now suppose,
in a family, one member becomes insane, a
misfortune which may happen to anybody; the
future generations from that family will be slightly
more liable to become insane than are ordinary
people. If the brother of the man who went insane
married a perfectly healthy girl, the tendency of
their child to become insane diminishes, because
one of his parents brings a good family history.
But if this brother marries one of his relations, their
child is far more likely to become insane, because
both his parents have bad family histories. The
long and short of the matter is this; there is no
reason, from a medical point of view, why cousins
should not marry if both are healthy, and if their
family history is good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Massie.</span>—We can understand your alarm when the
surgeon suggested that he should “cut you open
to see what is the matter with you.” But you did
very wrong in refusing to give your consent to the
procedure. It is exceedingly common to open the
abdomen to discover the cause of obscure diseases.
Many persons may think that it is not justifiable to
perform an operation merely to satisfy curiosity.
If this is the way you put it, we agree with you.
It is criminal to perform an operation merely to
satisfy curiosity! But such a thing is never done.
We open the abdomen to find out the actual cause
of obscure diseases in that locality; but we do so,
not so much to establish a diagnosis as to see if the
disease is capable of removal. Nowadays abdominal
section of this kind is a trivial manœuvre,
and although there is a certain amount of risk in
the procedure, it is nothing when compared with
the danger of allowing a progressive disease to run
its course unchecked. From your letter, we take it
that the surgeon thinks that you have something
obstructing your bowels—he does not know what.
It is very seldom possible to tell what these diseases
really are without exploring. He asks you for your
consent to let him open your abdomen, see what
the disease is, remove it if possible, and if not, to
express a definite opinion upon it. You say,
“What a terrible thing it would be, if he cut me and
found nothing!” It would certainly be a pity, but,
after all, what better news can you wish for?</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
